## Registlet List

A Registlet is a system that powers up your character directly or makes skills more powerful by using various "Gem Cases".

Toram players usually call each individual "Gem Case" a "Registlet", regardless of what the developers originally named them.  
So, this list also uses the word "registlet" instead of "gem case".
